# Gulp-lang
Gulp is an esoteric, deque based, golfing programming language made to win many CG challenges. It has 128 commands, each one often having many funcrions at once. This tutorial will run you through the basics in order to start programming right away, and all commamds that are not explained here, will be in a chart soon to be in this repo.
# Syntax
The syntax of Fulp is very simple. It consists of one commamd folllwed by a parameter. The only exceptions are commamds which have to surround their parameters, and commands which have several parameters. Many properties in this language also affect the jse of commands.
# Printing
Printing is simple in this language. Anything surroumded in single quotes is automatically pushed to the front of the deque, and printed. Take this Hello World Program as an example.

'Hello, world!'

As  mentioned before, Gulp has properties that make golfing easier. One of these properties is auto quotation. When a string literal without the closing single quote is entered, then its still valid. The interpreter treats it the same way as a complete steing literal. e.g

'Hello, world!

This is still valid. There are still many commamds, however, that deal with printing as part of their functions. 
# Variables
Variablez are an important part of golfing. Which is why variables are easy to understand. Variables are declared with the    "o" command (notice how the o is lowercase. Gulp is case sensitive, so capital O has a different function). Fooloowing the o command is a variable name, which can only be 1 byte in lenth, and the value of the variable. e.f

oi99

This program declares the variable i with value 99.
